### Introduction

This MATLAB code is a modified implementation of the network flow code originally released by Hamed Pirsiavash in CVPR 2011. This 
code is relatively easier to use and allow one to add pairwise cost along with the observation costs. Meaning you can add cost to your 
edges as well as your nodes in a graph.
